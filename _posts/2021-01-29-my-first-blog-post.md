<h1>A Blog for developers</h1>
<br>
<h2>My personal journey from Automation Electrician to Web Developer</h2>
<br>
<p>Thank you for reading my blog. I hope you can find usefull information here. <br>
   As a person who has very little experience with development, I feel like i'm <br>
   in a fortunate position to teach a beginner. </p>
