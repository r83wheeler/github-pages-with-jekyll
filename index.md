  <strong>I'm glad you are here.</strong> This blog will be about my path from Automation Electrician to Web Developer. I was an electrician for 16 years, and now at the age of 37, I've decided to move away from my comfort zone and jump into this coding bootcamp. I'm very excited because I see so many opportunities opening up for me, as I learn these new skills. My goal for this blog is to provide helpful content for you, and also serve as a learning tool for myself.
